<p>
Photography is the process of creating still or moving pictures by recording radiation on a sensitive medium like film or an electronic sensor. The products of photography are called negatives and photographs, the latter being developed from the negatives. Light patterns reflected or emitted by objects activate a sensitive chemical or electronic sensor during a timed exposure usually through a photographic lens in a camera. The camera stores the resulting information chemically or electronically.
</p> 
<br>
<p>
Photographers control the camera and lens to expose the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a latent image (on film) or raw file (in digital camera) which, after due processing, is converted to a usable image. In digital cameras, instead of film, an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive devices is used.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Photography can also be called an art and good photographers often exhibit their oeuvre like artists exhibit their paintings. In fact, the Greek word for photography means ‘drawing with light’. Photography has many applications in business, science and filmmaking, fashion, tourism, advertising, etc.
